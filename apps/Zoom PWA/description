Progressive Web App for Zoom
This is chromium-browser running Zoom. Performance is much better that emulated x86/x86_64 Zoom in almost all cases.
Both versions can be installed at the same time and will not interfere with each another.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Zoom PWA
To run in a terminal: zoom-pwa
